# YouTube-search-bar-in-an-HTML-page

This code creates a simple HTML form with a search input and a button. When the button is clicked, the search() function is called. The function retrieves the search term from the input and uses it to make an HTTP request to the YouTube Data API. The API returns a JSON object containing the search results, which the code then parses and displays in the page. Note that you will need to replace YOUR_API_KEY with your own YouTube Data API key.
